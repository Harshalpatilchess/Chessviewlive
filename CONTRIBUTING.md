# Contributing

- **Workflow Split**: 
  - **VS Code**: Use `main` or related web-focused branches.
  - **Antigravity**: Use mobile-focused branches (e.g., `feat/mobile-*`).
- **Shared Code**: Changes to shared packages (like `@chessview/core`) must go through Pull Requests (PRs) to ensure stability across both web and mobile platforms.
