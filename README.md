# ChessViewLive

Simple prototype for ChessViewLive.  
Make it easy for tournament organisers to broadcast chess games with minimal setup.

## One-line
Broadcast chess tournaments from mobile devices to your website with optional digital boards and PGN export.

## Current status
- Prototype live at: https://harshalpatilchess.github.io/Chessviewlive/  
- Purpose: validate demand and device setup.

## Who this is for
- Organisers who want a low-cost streaming solution.  
- Chess clubs and schools.  
- Developers and partners helping build the product.

## How to demo
1. Open the GitHub Pages prototype link above.  
2. Use the “Demo — Watch sample stream” link on the prototype (if available).

## Short technical notes
- Streams will be ingested via RTMP or managed streaming service. (RTMP: standard protocol devices push to.)  
- Game moves will be shown using a digital board (chessboard.js or chessground) and stored as PGN. (PGN: text format for chess games.)

## Next small milestones
1. Clear landing headline and two CTAs.  
2. Add 1–2 embedded demo players.  
3. Create Issues and an MVP milestone.  
4. Add a simple organiser dashboard mock.  
5. Add initial contact info.

## How you can help
